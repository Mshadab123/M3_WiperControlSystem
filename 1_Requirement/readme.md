# Requriments


## Description

This Project is an Wiper control (WCS) system,a wiper control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions.It useful in the automotive unit the main purpose of the system is to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times.

## Identifying features

When the button is pressed once the car will start (Ignition key postion at ACC) When the button is pressed again the wiper will start(Wiper On) When the button is pressed again the wiper will off(Wiper Off) When the button is pressed thrice the car will stop(Ignition key position at Lock) State of art

The main focus point is seeing the wiper control of the car. And also seeing the seep of the wiper system in the car Now this two features are explained in these project

## 5W's & 1H and S.W.O.T analysis is in the below table

## | 5W's & 1H |

* What -- wiper control system (WCS)

* Where --Inside and out side the car

* When --When the weather condition is bad (like in rain and snow) the wiper is activate and clean the car window

* Who --Who is driving or controlling the car

* How --By using STM like by multiple pushes on a button

Strengths

* No human interaction with car

* Manages all commands with one key automatically

* encryption in data

Weaknesses

* Unable to monitor status of car

* Range is limited

* Wait for certain time after every command to press new command

Opportunities

* The Scope of this sytem is huge in car control

* can be used where the car need thesed command

* Less cost

Threats

* When new command is given without completing the current command it will not take current command
